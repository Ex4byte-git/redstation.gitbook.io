Iâ€™ve spent the last 15 years working in offensive security, with a strong focus on Windows research and exploitation, red teaming, and developing training labs. I also delivered live training sessions to help others build their skills. Currently, I split my time between working as a red teamer at Mantodea Security and creating lab environments at kpmg.

Outside of security, I love exploring Japanese language and culture.
